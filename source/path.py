# path.py:
#
# This module is the "assistant" of the Symbolic Execution engine. Clearly, the unrestricted usage
# of symbolic execution can cause BOPC to run for ever (bottleneck). To address this problem,
# we aim to restrict the Symbolic Execution as much as possible. So, instead of letting Symbolic
# Execution engine to use it's build-in BFS for the path exploration, we find out (i.e., guess) the
# exact path(s) and we _guide_ the Symbolic Execution engine to strictly follow them. Therefore, we
# avoid the exponential growth of the states.
#
# In case that the recommended path does not work out (due to the unsatisfiable constraints), we
# need to try another path and so on. In the worst case we will try all the paths and the result
# will be the same with the unguided Symbolic Execution. Having a way to quickly generate candidate
# paths is crucial here.
#
# The trick here is to "rank" the paths, starting from the one which is more likely to succeed. A
# good metric here is the path length in the CFG (shortest paths in CFG are not like shortest paths
# in normal graphs, due to the context sensitivity). Therefore, we start with the shortest path
# first, then we move on the second shortest path and so on.

#                        v                  +------+ retn
#
#   Let's assume that our code doesn't have any loops. This means that it's impossible to move from
#   {A} to {B} under program execution and hence, such a path should not exist. However, if we
#   apply a classic shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra), we will find a path, that goes from
#   {A} to foo(), then to the return point of foo() and then to the instruction right after the 1st
#   call thus ending up at {B}. The main cause of this issue is that in CFG, a block with a retn,
#   has an edge to every possible return point and the shortest path algorithm does not take into
#   consideration the current "context".
#
#   A naive solution here, is to keep track of the current path, using backpointers. Every time we
#   encounter a return instruction, we move backwards to the point that this function was invoked
#   and we pick the appropriate edge, that take us to the instruction right after call.
#   
#   The problem with this solution, is that it can easily fall into a _deadlock_. For instance,
#   consider the case where we have two paths in the priority queue. The 1st path has visited few
#   blocks of some function foo(), and therefore they are marked as visited. Now, the 2nd path
#   reaches a block that calls foo(). If foo() has already been analyzed, we can simply follow the
#   "fakeret" edge and use foo()'s length (or "depth") as edge weight. Unfortunately,we don't know
#   that (as it's under inspection by the 1st path) and we can't visit it twice, thus creating a
#   deadlock
#
#
#   The problem gets even harder when CFG contains recursive functions or sets of functions that
#   form a cycle in the Call Graph). Our approach is to use a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm. If
#   a function doesn't have any callees, a classic Dijsktra suffices to find out the shortest 
#   paths. Otherwise, we recursively do a Dijkstra for each calling function. Thus, we can get each
#   function's depth before we continue searching. Finally, we also need a Call Stack to avoid
#   infinity loops when we analyze recursive functions.
